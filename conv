; Instances of all the below struc types must be aligned at 8-byte boundary, so
; that loads and stores of the fields are atomic.  Instances of task and queue
; strucs must be aligned at 128-byte boundary, for processor bus locking
; efficiency.  Those statically allocated in the .data section are properly
; aligned, because the section is specified to be aligned at 128-byte and the
; strucs are specified to be aligned at 128-byte.  Because all the strucs have
; qword fields, this preserves the correct 8-byte alignment.  Because task
; strucs are 128 bytes long, this preserves the correct 128-byte alignment when
; they are located contiguously.  Task strucs dynamically allocated by mmap are
; properly aligned, because mmap allocates pages on page boundary.

; TODO?: The .need field could be the lower bits of the .next field, and the
; .ridx field could be the lower bits of the .rcvr field, because the .next and
; .rcvr fields are pointers to task strucs which are always 128-byte aligned
; which means the pointers don't need the lower 7 bits, which is enough for
; values up to 127 which is more than enough for .need and .ridx.  This would
; give 2 more argument fields, for which .need and .ridx values would range from
; 0 (.exec) to 13, which fits in 4 bits.

; For executable-tasks queues, a queue struc's .next pointer is not changed once
