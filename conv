; Instances of all the below struc types must be aligned at 8-byte boundary, so
; that loads and stores of the fields are atomic.  Instances of task and queue
; strucs must be aligned at 128-byte boundary, for processor bus locking
; efficiency.  Those statically allocated in the .data section are properly
; aligned, because the section is specified to be aligned at 128-byte and the
; strucs are specified to be aligned at 128-byte.  Because all the strucs have
; qword fields, this preserves the correct 8-byte alignment.  Because task
; strucs are 128 bytes long, this preserves the correct 128-byte alignment when
; they are located contiguously.  Task strucs dynamically allocated by mmap are
; properly aligned, because mmap allocates pages on page boundary.

; TODO?: The .need field could be the lower bits of the .next field, and the
; .ridx field could be the lower bits of the .rcvr field, because the .next and
; .rcvr fields are pointers to task strucs which are always 128-byte aligned
; which means the pointers don't need the lower 7 bits, which is enough for
; values up to 127 which is more than enough for .need and .ridx.  This would
; give 2 more argument fields, for which .need and .ridx values would range from
; 0 (.exec) to 13, which fits in 4 bits.

; For executable-tasks queues, a queue struc's .next pointer is not changed once
; initialized, which allows concurrent reading of it without locking.  The
; lowest bit of the .next field is the lock variable for accessing the .head or
; .tail fields, and this is alright because all queue strucs are aligned such
; that pointers never need the lowest bit.  For thread-private allocatable-tasks
; queues, concurrent access doesn't occur, the .next field is never used, and
; there is no lock for accessing the .head or .tail fields.  For the shared
; allocatable-tasks queue, concurrent access does occur, and the .next field is
; used only for the lock bit.  The size field is used only for thread-private
; allocatable-tasks queues, but if statistics collection is enabled then the
; size field is used for the executable-tasks queues also.
