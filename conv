; Instances of all the below struc types must be aligned at 8-byte boundary, so
; that loads and stores of the fields are atomic.  Instances of task strucs must
; be aligned at 128-byte boundary, for processor bus locking efficiency.  Those
; statically allocated in the .data section are properly aligned, because the
; section is specified to be aligned at 128-byte and the strucs are specified to
; be aligned at 128-byte.  Because all the strucs have qword fields, this
; preserves the correct 8-byte alignment.  Because task strucs are 128 bytes
; long, this preserves the correct 128-byte alignment when they are located
; contiguously.  Task strucs dynamically allocated by mmap are properly aligned,
; because mmap allocates pages on page boundary.

; TODO?: The .need field could be the lower bits of the .next field, and the
; .ridx field could be the lower bits of the .rcvr field, because the .next and
; .rcvr fields are pointers to task strucs which are always 128-byte aligned
; which means the pointers don't need the lower 7 bits, which is enough for
; values up to 127 which is more than enough for .need and .ridx.  This would
; give 2 more argument fields, for which .need and .ridx values would range from
; 0 (.exec) to 13, which fits in 4 bits.
