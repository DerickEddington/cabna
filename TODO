Investigate variation of queue implementation where the locks
are the lowest bit of the pointers to nodes.  Is
concurrency-safety possible?  Will require nodes' addresses
to be aligned such that lowest bit can be ignored.

Investigate opportunities to optimize assembly source for
speed and size, such as "mov byte" instead of "mov qword".
