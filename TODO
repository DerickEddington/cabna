Investigate multi-threading via print-outs.

Investigate the performance of making threads spin-wait for their own exec queue
instead of trying other threads'.  Maybe rearrange jumping so that pause only
happens if spinning.  exec_avail still needs to try other threads' if its is
empty.

Investigate creating more than 2 threads.

Determine the stack size given to the initial thread.  Decide what size to give
other threads.  Minimum is 16384 (16 kb, 4 pages).

Review the optimization guideline points again.

Make a simple Scheme-like interpreter written in assembly and using the task
queueing and execution facilities.  I think this is an easy step towards using
the parallel processing without having a compiler.  Useful parallel programs
(including a compiler) can be interpreted.

Investigate what NASM directives are neccessary to make a shared library.
