All instructions which set a register to 0 should use xor instead.

Investigate opportunities to optimize assembly source for speed and size, such
as "mov byte" instead of "mov qword".

Implement thread creation per number of processors, at program start-up.  This
will allow exploring parallelism, even though the thread creation design might
change in the future.  I think using Linux's clone is the way to go.

Make a simple Scheme-like interpreter written in assembly and using the task
queueing and execution facilities.  I think this is an easy step towards using
the parallel processing without having a compiler.  Useful parallel programs
(including a compiler) can be interpreted.
