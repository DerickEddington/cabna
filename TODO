Investigate variation of queue implementation where the locks
are the lowest bit of the pointers to nodes.  Is
concurrency-safety possible?  Will require nodes' addresses
to be aligned such that lowest bit can be ignored.

Use DEFAULT REL for RIP-relative addressing.  Make new
"directives" file for inclusion by project files.

Investigate opportunities to optimize assembly source for
speed and size, such as "mov byte" instead of "mov qword".
