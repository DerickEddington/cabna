E.g.: sys/sched-exec/needy-spin, sys/sched-exec/needy-mutex,
sys/sched-exec/deque-spin, sys/sched-exec/deque-mutex;
sys/task-alloc/orphans-incr, sys/task-alloc/orphans-batch; lib/mutex/spin,
lib/mutex/futex-tristate, lib/mutex/futex-bivar; lib/deque-mr-mw,
lib/stack-sr-mw, lib/stack-mr-mw, lib/fifo-sr-mw, lib/fifo-mr-mw, etc.

Maybe it's a good idea to have a policy such that interchangeable modules' files
are in a folder named for the module (e.g. sched-exec/*); and
non-interchangeable modules' files are prefix-ed with the name of what they have
in common (e.g. fifo-*).

There are two goals here: First, interchangeable implementations offering
different performance profiles; Second, reuseable implementations for the
runtime and/or users.  Each goal does not need to be concerned about
accomplishing the other goal.
